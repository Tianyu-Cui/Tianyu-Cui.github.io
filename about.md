I am a graduate student in the [UConn EEB department](https://eeb.uconn.edu) interested in plant diversity and evolution. My research focuses on the evolution of pollination syndromes and the genetic basis of morphological diversity. 
As a naturalist, I have a keen interest in photographing and identifying flowering plants, butterflies, birds and atmospheric optical phenomena. I also enjoy reading, painting, and listening to classical music.
